ROBOBACKUPS2.BAT, Written by Mark Matthias, 2016

The file with the trailing "2" is a bit superior to the other file
since the variable decls are less confusing. I set it to run regularly
using the MS Windows scheduler app.

The script served me well at work to save off important files to 
an external HD. I would like to give it another go to see if I 
can make it easier to edit and more customizable.

The small one was probably the easiest since it was so simple 
(robo_replicator.bat), no source directories had to be specified.
